Wii Mouse
============

Basically, an air mouse using an imu that can be used without a mouse pad (or really, a desk).

* Move it around to simulate mouse moves
* Two buttons that gives right/left click functionalities
* Rotate left or right to scroll


TODO List
============

* Make a demo video
* Make it general - now it works with X-IMU only. Implement state estimation and Arduino codes to make it work with other IMUs as well
